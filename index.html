    <p>Hello, I'm Emily, and I have been living in Utah
       for three years now. I was born and raised in South-Eastern Michigan
       and continue to visit often. Growing up surrounded by water,
       I fell in love with swimming, boating, and visiting the beach. 
       In Utah, water is scarce. Good thing I find beauty in nature as a whole.
       Since moving to Utah, I have explored the mountains surrounding 
       Salt lake City, down to the deserts of southern Utah. I love to 
       explore and experience new things. I have learned to rock climb, rappel,
       backpack, and many wilderness survival skills since moving to Utah.
       I moved to Utah seeking adventure, independance, and work at a wilderness,
       adventure, therapy company named, Aspiro. I have worked in psych for many
       years and appreciate the care I can provide, along with the challenges it provides.
       Being a person who loves a challenge, I decided to explore the world of 
       coding. I am currently
       enrolled in the Coding Bootcamp through the University of Utah.
       This new path of learning has given me excitement for my future
       with anticiation of where I will go. With this new career path 
       I plan to join the family business as a full-stack developer. My 
       family started their own computer company from the ground up, which 
       has taught me that with perserverance and hard work I can accomplish
       anything I want to in life. I am excited to say this is the beginning
       of a new chapter.
